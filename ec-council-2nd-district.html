                    <p>Johnson is running for re-election in the 2nd District and, at 42, is the youngest member of City Council. Born and raised in Point Breeze, Johnson started his political career as a senate staffer in Harrisburg. In 2008, he was elected State Rep. for the 186th Legislative District and served one and a half terms. He left the Statehouse to begin his first term on City Council in January 2012, after narrowly beating real estate developer Barbara Capozzi in the 2011 primary.

Johnson is a disciple of the late Democratic State Sen. Hardy Williams, the father of the mayoral candidate and current State Sen. Anthony Williams. Johnson's wife, Dawn Chavous is Sen. Williams' Chief of Staff. They live in Point Breeze with their 6-month-old son.

Johnson earned his B.A. from Mansfield University in 2006 and holds a master's degree in government administration from the Fels Institute of Government at University of Pennsylvania.
