                    <p>﻿﻿﻿Regarded as one of the state's top litigators before being elected as a Superior Court judge, she was raised in a blue-collar home. There, she says, she learned the value of hard work and the "meaning of integrity," and was the first in her family to go to college.  
  
As a lawyer, Donahue, 62, focused on personal injury and contract law, "protecting the rights of injured persons, holding corporations accountable for fraudulent behavior, eliminating bias against LGBT parents in custody matters and more."  
  
She won the state bar association's highest recommendation, and the endorsement of a long list of traditional Democratic constituencies including over a dozen major unions.  
  
Among her concerns is improving the accessibility of the court and what she calls its "vast" administrative functions, and she pledges to bring "transparency" to the court as well as "the insights ... of a long time practitioner who actually brought cases to court.”

Donahue was raised in the Lehigh Valley, the daughter of a union seamstress and a "coal cracker." She now lives in Pittsburgh.  

In its endorsement of her, The Pittsburgh Gazette wrote: "She takes pride in the Superior Court holding sessions away from the major cities and we were impressed by her desire to bring the judges’ work closer to the people — something she’d like the Supreme Court to do."  
  
She attended East Stroudsburg University and the Duquesne University School of Law.  
  
She's raised about $166K.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="ec-subheading">Bio</h4>
                    <p>Among the best-known and by far the best-funded candidate for Supreme Court, Kevin Dougherty, 53, brings a unique package of experience, interests, connections and concerns to the campaign.  <br />
  
Dougherty, the brother of Philadelphia labor leader John "Johnny Doc" Dougherty, has extensive experience both adjudicating cases and managing courts, and speaks regularly as a specialist on juvenile justice policy, a focus since the beginning of his career.  <br />
  
He once said of his work in Family Court: “I see the anguish in children’s faces. I see the breaking of their hearts when their parents don’t want them. When I speak to a child that has never heard the words ‘I love you,’ it’s the incentive I need to verbalize my love for my kids and make sure I squeeze them and hug them that much extra.”  <br />
  
Dougherty spent almost ten years administering Philadelphia's Family Court, and is the current administrator of the local district of the Court of Common Pleas, in charge of "120 judges, four main courthouses, approximately 2,000 employees and an annual budget of $106 million."  <br />
  
In addition to some years in private practice, he has also served as an assistant district attorney and a truancy officer. As a Supreme Court justice, he hopes to help “bring closure to the wounds of (the court's) reputation" and help it provide "good things for good families."<br />

“I want the black robe I wear to be viewed by those who come before me as a beacon of hope rather than a symbol of fear,” he has said.<br />

He claims to be an "experienced, compassionate" candidate, and he's been recommended by both the local and state bar associations, but the possible influence of his deep-pocketed supporters continues to raise the concerns of judicial reform advocates.  <br />
  
Lynn Marks, head of the reform-minded group Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, calls him a <a href="articles.philly.com:2015-04-17:news:61222449_1_general-election-supreme-court-candidates" style="color:#428BC9;">“credible”</a>  candidate but adds, “It's really hard to argue that people's perception of such a system is not corroded when judges can accept huge amounts of money from groups and individuals who could very well come before them”  <br />
  
Dougherty remains firm that he'll remain independent, telling the Philadelphia Inquirer that "my brother has never influenced me on the bench or in any decisions I’ve made, and telling the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he would recuse himself from any cases involving conflicts of interest with his brother.  <br />
  
"What separates me is that I come from a completely different world," he said. "He's in the world of labor. I'm in the world of law.” <br /> 

In his candidate's questionnaire, Dougherty stressed his independence, and noted that his professional resume remains long on substance and clear of black marks: "I am proud of my record of not having been reversed on appeal in numerous cases where I reconciled conflicting provisions of Pennsylvania’s family law  … I am also proud of my reputation for judicial independence and propriety. I have never been criticized for a biased approach or been influenced by outside factors," he wrote.  <br />
  
(To buttress that claim, his questionnaire details his personal legal history: in 2004, he was the defendant in a $662 small-claims case that settled "amicably"; in 2010 he was deposed as a witness in the bankruptcy proceedings that surrounding the construction of the new Family Court building; and through the years he's been named in his official capacity in "numerous" civil proceedings challenging Family Court rulings.  <br />
  
(Otherwise, he writes, "I have not been a party to, or involved in, or had a pecuniary interest in, any civil or criminal proceeding. I have not been a party in interest or a material witness in any legal proceeding and have never been named as a co-conspirator or co-respondent. I have never appeared as a witness in, or been the subject of, any grand jury proceeding.")  <br />

Dougherty has raised more money than any other candidate, topping $700,000 as of early April. Almost half of that - about $300,000 - came from the union controlled by his brother, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  <br />
  
He studied at Temple University and Antioch School of Law.  <br />
  
As of early April, he was reported to be one of just three candidates with more than $500,000 on hand.</p>

"In my nearly 25 years on the bench I’ve been very concerned about what I see coming from the Supreme Court in terms of appointments to commissions, boards, even administrative judges," said Allen.

"I bring critical, front line experience. I know what it’s like to sentence someone to death and look them in the eye. The real life on the front lines isn’t as clean as it is in the legal libraries."<br />

                    <p>Appointed by Gov. Tom Corbett in 2011 to the Supreme Court to replace the disgraced Orie Melvin, Correale "Corry" Stevens, 68, has been deeply rooted in Northeast Pennsylvania for his whole career: lawyer, town solicitor, state representative, district attorney, county judge.  <br />
  
Elected to the Superior Court in 1998, he earned a reputation as a "workhorse" one local writer analyzed his opinions on a variety of cases and found "a judge who is prosecution-oriented, but who respects important constitutional rights … conservative, but well-reasoned.”  <br />
  
Prior to replacing Melvin in 2011, Stevens served as president of the Superior Court, a position to which he was elected by his judicial colleagues; he earned bipartisan endorsements in his run for a county judgeship, and won unanimous approval by the state Senate when appointed to the Supreme Court.  <br />
  
Then-Chief Justice head Ron Castille welcomed him to the state's highest bench, citing his "wealth of experience" as a lawyer, judge and legislator, and his "commitment and determination" to master new challenges (according to one press report, Stevens got the news of his confirmation while he was getting married: "Stevens said he turned off his cellphone after it began vibrating continually during the ceremony, with senators calling to share the news. He got the details after exchanging vows with his wife").<br />

Stevens says voters can rely on him to balance Constitutional rights of the accused against those of the police & of victims: “I've never written any opinion that jeopardizes the safety of law enforcement.”  <br />
  
Stevens attended Penn State and Dickinson Law.  <br />
  
Stevens has raised a small amount so far, about $44,000, and says he'll "raise enough money to be competitive, but not enough money that's going to cause ethical problems.

                        <li>Pa. Bar withheld recommendation because of concerns about her lack of appellate court experience, administrative experience, and temperament. She calls the bar association a "liberal organization" with a "history of supporting criminals," and calls herself "qualified and community-minded."

                    <h4 class="ec-subheading">Bio</h4>
                    <p>﻿﻿Warren, 48 and a native of Danville, Pa,, has spent most of her career as a civil litigator, but four years ago was elected DA of central Pennsylvania's Montour County (pop. 18,000).  <br />
  
An unapologetic backer of "victims rights" as an attorney, Warren says she's "particularly passionate about protecting our elderly and children." She has earned a reputation as a friend of law enforcement as a DA - the county's first woman to serve in that post. She calls herself a supporter of the Constitution who understands rural interests: “It’s important for someone not from Philadelphia or Pittsburgh to be on the court to represent the average voter in Pennsylvania.”<br />

For this election she has earned the endorsement of a coalition of local sheriffs and DAs, but not of the Pennsylvania Bar Association, which gave her this year's only "not recommended" rating.  <br />
  
She responded: "The opinion of one private interest organization does not deter qualified and community-minded candidates such as myself.”  <br />
  
Warren is a graduate of Bloomsburg University and Dickinson School of Law.  <br />
  
As of early April, campaign finance reports indicate that she had a negative fund balance.
