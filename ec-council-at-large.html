                    <p>Councilman William Greenlee, 62, is a lifelong resident of the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia. He is a graduate of St. Joseph’s Prep and Temple University. He and his wife Leslie, a teacher, have been married for over 25 years. 

In 1980, he began a 26-year career working as chief aide to City Councilman David Cohen, providing constituent services and working on legislative issues. He was elected to City Council in 2006.

Championing earned paid sick leave in Philadelphia is one of Councilman Greenlee’s most recent legislative accomplishments. Greenlee also introduced a bill protecting the rights of pregnant workers and women who are nursing.

Councilman Greenlee was the sponsor of legislation to overhaul the Fair Practices ordinance, which is the City’s Civil Rights Legislation. The Ordinance prohibits discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. The update of the law expands the protected classes of citizens to include domestic violence victims, the disabled and the LGBT community."
